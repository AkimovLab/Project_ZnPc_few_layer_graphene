# Project_ZnPc_few_layer_graphene
This repository includes all input files created and used for NAMD study of electron transfer at Zn-phthalocyanine/few-layer graphene

1-The file named graphene.80r.8k is an input quantum espresso (QE) job which does the pre-dos (nscf) calculations for optimized graphene.

2-The file named graph_znpc.70r.6k.ns is an input QE file job which does pre-dos (nscf) calculations for optimized ZnPc/single-layer graphene interface.

3-The file named 2lgraph_znpc.80r.6k.ns is an input QE file job which does pre-dos (nscf) calculations for optimized ZnPc/double-layer graphene interface.
